                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p>
                    I have 10 years of professional experience and a Certificate in
                    Software Development. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a child and an adult, I have always had a passion for video games and I always found myself curious as to how they
                    worked. After highschool I decided to pursue an education in respiratory therapy and after 2 years in college 
                    I decided that was no longer the path I wanted. I wanted to pursue a career in the transportation 
                    industry so I then went to school to become a truck driver and I earned a certificate of completion in CMV Knowledge
                    and obtained a commercial driver's license. After 4 years in the transportation industry I felt this was not the career that I wanted but
                    it was something I wanted to improve so I joined a coding bootcamp and earned a Certificate of Software Development. I realized that Software Development has 
                    always been my passion and I finally pursued it. My vision is to help develop software that will improve the way the trucking industry works
                    by helping truck drivers find a place to sleep or a place to find healthy food while helping businesses market to them and create competition
                    to lower the cost of living on the driver.
